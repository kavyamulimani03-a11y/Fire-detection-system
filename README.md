# Fire-detection-system
Fire detection using surveillance cameras 
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fire in real-time using surveillance camera footage. The system analyzes video frames using computer vision and machine learning techniques to identify fire and highlight its location within the frame.
The main goal of this project is to provide early fire detection to improve safety in public areas, industries, and smart surveillance systems.
🎯 Objectives
Detect fire from live or recorded video streams
Identify and localize fire regions in the frame
Provide early alerts for faster response
Improve safety using AI-based monitoring
🛠 Technologies Used
